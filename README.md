# Hi, I'm [submergepsc] 👋

**Sophomore • Sun Yat-sen University '28**  
School of Software Engineering

`C++` `Qt` `Go` `Python` `MySQL` `Docker` `AI` `Blockchain`

A second-year student who fell in love with backend & systems,  
still at the very beginning, but running fast.

### 🌱 About Me
- Currently a **2nd-year undergraduate** at SYSU Software Engineering
- Just finished data structures, operating systems, and computer networks — every class opens a new world
- Spending most of my spare time exploring backend development, AI, and blockchain
- My knowledge is still shallow, but my curiosity is deep 😄
- Trying to turn every "I don't know yet" into "Let me figure it out"

### 🔭 Current Focus
- Building solid backend fundamentals (concurrency, databases, microservices)
- Learning how large language models really work under the hood
- Understanding blockchain from cryptography → consensus → EVM/ZK
- Contributing tiny PRs to open-source projects (even if it's just fixing a typo)

### 🛠️ Tech Stack (What I've touched so far)
